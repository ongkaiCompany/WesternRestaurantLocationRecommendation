# Western Restaurant Location Recommendation using Unsupervised Machine Learning
This Machine Learning Assignment used Clustering algorithms (K-Means, DBScan, BIRCH, Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering & Affinity Propagation) to find existing clusters of Western restaurants in Singapore so as to determine areas of lesser competition (based on customer ratings).  
<br/>
We excluded DBSCAN's results from our analysis for their lack of visual appeal. After evaluating the remaining 4 clustering outcomes, we suggest locating the new western
restaurant in the upper northern area of Singapore (less competition)
